# Designs

My personal collection of parametrics 3D designs for printing.

At some point, I'll start uploading rendered STLs to either here or something
like thingiverse. Ideally, I'll find some form of automation to handle all
that for me.

## Rendering

1. Install a recent development version of [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).
1. Install the [BOSL2 library](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2).
1. Enable `fast-csg` and `lazy-unions`.
1. Render!

## Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, questions, and requests are all welcome via Github Issues!

Though the turn around time is likely to be abysmal.
